# Pre-trained model Preparation

Please follow these instructions for pre-trained model preparation for training.

1. Download the *Deeplab-v2* model trained for semantic segmentation on [SketchyScene](https://github.com/SketchyScene/SketchyScene) dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11sI3IARgAKTf4rut1isQgTOdGKFeyZ1c?usp=sharing).

1. Create a directory named `SketchyScene_DeepLabv2` under this root and place the model inside.

1. (Opt) We have also provided the code for other alternatives for sketch image feature extraction, such as *FCN-8s*, *SegNet* and *Deeplab-v3+*. But we have not provided the pre-trained models since they are too large. If you are in need of them, please email us :)
